        <p>It’s no exaggeration to say that every job is a “tech” job nowadays, demanding everyone posses more technical
            skills. Even traditionally <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/best-industries-for-tech-jobs/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">non-technical industries</a>, like financial services, higher education, or
            government, are integrating technology and algorithms into their work.&nbsp;</p>



        <p>Whether you manage marketers, analysts, salespeople, product managers, or other non-technical specialists,
            technical skills can help prepare your team for the future. With our interactive courses and guided paths,
            your whole team can learn valuable technical skills like machine learning, data science, and web

        <p>Our <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Codecademy Teams
                offering</a> enables you to assign customized content to your reports and use analytics and reporting

                for Codecademy Teams</a> and invite up to 25 people. Read on to explore the many benefits of having your
            non-technical employees learn technical skills.&nbsp;</p>



        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Provide your employees with development opportunities</strong>&nbsp;
        </h2>



        <p>As companies continue to embrace digital transformation, the ability to use technology effectively is
            essential for anyone to succeed in their career. In fact, according to the National Skills Coalition, <a
                href="https://nationalskillscoalition.org/news/press-releases/new-report-92-of-jobs-require-digital-skills-one-third-of-workers-have-low-or-no-digital-skills-due-to-historic-underinvestment-structural-inequities/"
                target="_blank">92% of jobs today require digital skills.</a></p>



        <p>As an example, whether you work in sales, marketing, project management, design or many other non-technical
            fields, knowing how to organize, analyze, and visualize data is one technical area that can provide more
            opportunities for career growth. That’s because employees who posses <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/data-analytics">data analytics skills</a> can uncover
            new information that helps inform decisions.&nbsp;</p>



        <p>Similarly, non-technical employees can benefit from learning basic <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> skills. From managing
            sensitive information to using email and social media, individuals are constantly at risk of cyber threats
            like phishing, identity theft, and malware. Having a fundamental understanding of cybersecurity practices,
            such as creating strong passwords, recognizing suspicious emails, and safeguarding personal data, can
            significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to these attacks. That’s why Codecademy offers a free <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-cybersecurity">Introduction to Cybersecurity</a>
            course.</p>



        <p>By providing your non-technical employees with a way to learn something new, you give them the opportunity to
            advance in their current roles or uncover new areas they may have an interest in, or aptitude for. When your
            employees have support to meet their evolving professional goals, they’re more likely to stay at your
            company.&nbsp;</p>



        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2.  Improve communication within and across teams</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



        <p>Even if your non-technical team members don’t move into technical positions, technical skills can greatly
            enhance their current roles — especially when it comes to communication.&nbsp;</p>



        <p>When people in roles like Product Managers or Product Marketers have technical knowledge, they’re able to
            speak the same language as the engineers, developers, or customers they’re working with. <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/from-civil-engineer-to-product-owner/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">Codecademy learner Jan Osterž</a> started learning technical skills while
            working as a Product Owner at a software engineering company. His experience with product management and
            understanding of development principles made cross-functional collaboration a breeze:&nbsp;</p>



        <p><em>“</em><em>This combined knowledge, much of which I acquired through Codecademy, allows me
                to </em><em>have better technical conversations with the development lead</em><em> and the developers.
                For example, if we get a younger developer, I can provide tips and guidance. I can suggest directions to
                explore</em><em>…</em><em> [</em><em>or</em><em>]</em><em> recommend libraries to use. All this
                knowledge helps me manage and integrate both aspects of my work effectively.” </em><em></em>&nbsp;</p>



        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Build better products</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



        <p>By understanding what developers, engineers, and data scientists do, non-technical roles are in a better
            position to work with them to co-create solutions or products, ultimately benefiting the business. They can
            think through requirements more easily and better gauge what’s possible — and what’s not. </p>



        <p>Take it from Codecademy Senior Product Designer Taylor Green, who emphasizes that <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-to-get-into-ui-ux-design">folks in design-heavy
                roles</a> should have a basic understanding of code. “If you can’t understand the languages or
            understand how to communicate with engineers, it’s definitely going to pose a barrier,” Taylor says.</p>



        <p>For instance, when considering a possible solution to a problem in a product, you can establish realistic
            expectations and workloads because you are aware of the behind-the-scenes processes involved.</p>



        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Instill confidence among your team</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



        <p>For non-technical employees working alongside their technically-trained counterparts, it’s possible for a bit
            of <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/overcoming-impostor-syndrome/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">impostor syndrome</a> to creep in. <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/from-restaurant-industry-to-senior-front-end-engineer/"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobby Velasco</a> learned technical skills with Codecademy and
            then landed his first real “tech job” as a Product Marketing Engineer, where he leveraged his new technical
            skills to take on more responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



        <p><em>“</em><em>I started doing anything I could get my hands on to get more experience. I just kept on
                learning and more opportunities kept getting thrown at me to do front-end engineering work, and some
                back-end tasks. I was hungry to get experience, and they allowed me to build the confidence and the
                skill set.</em><em>” </em>&nbsp;</p>



        <p>On top of the confidence boost, data suggests that filling skills gaps is one way you can help reduce stress
            for your entire team, according to the <a
                href="https://insight.skillsoft.com/it-skills-and-salary-report/p/1" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Skillsoft IT Skills &amp; Salary Report</a>. When people are overworked
            and lack the resources that they need to do their jobs, projects take longer, and business objectives
            suffer. &nbsp;</p>



        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Enhance your team’s problem-solving skills</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



        <p>Research out of the <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2023.pdf" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">World Economic Forum</a> <a href="http://future%20of%20jobs%20report/"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>shows that the top skills workers need in the future are
            analytical and creative thinking skills. You might think of problem solving as a soft skill. Even so, it’s
            one that’s best practiced through learning technical skills. For example, someone with data analysis skills
            can quickly identify trends and insights, while a team member with coding knowledge will understand <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-to-think-like-a-programmer/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">how to think like a programmer:</a> defining a problem, breaking it down into
            smaller pieces, and exploring various possible solutions.&nbsp;</p>



        <p>Joshua Lange is a <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/immunologist-learning-python-to-upskill-as-researcher/"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research Scientist who learned Python</a> so he could work
            more efficiently with large amounts of data. Once he got the hang of automating his work with one coding
            language, the “problem-solving way of thinking” broadened his perspective:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



        <p><em>“</em><em>Codecademy is a really cool platform, and the impact on my job has been immense. Not only does
                it save time, but it also makes me think in a different way. It’s encouraged other people to start
                looking into it as well. I’m not old by any means, but you’re never too old to continue
                learning.</em><em>”</em><em></em>&nbsp;</p>



        <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Prepare your organization for the jobs of tomorrow</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



        <p>Generative AI significantly transformed the way we all work, and the types of skills people need to remain
            competitive. In <a
                href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part%22%20/l%20%22section2"
                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft’s 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report</a>, the
            majority of leaders said they prioritize AI skills over experience when hiring candidates. It’s not just job
            seekers who benefit from AI proficiency: 69% of survey respondents said <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-ai/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">upskilling with AI</a> can help get them promoted faster.&nbsp;</p>



        <p><a href="http://world%20economic%20forum%20predicts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>There’s
            been a lot of talk about <a
                href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-ai-changes-programming-coding/" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">what AI advancements mean for the future of programming</a>. The way we code
            is definitely shifting because of AI — in a recent survey, 97% of professional developers said they <a

                target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use AI coding tools</a> in their workflow. At the same time,
            programming, determining instructions to give to a computer so it can execute a task, is becoming even more
            essential. Knowing <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/ai-prompt-engineering-tips/"

            responses from ChatGPT and how to evaluate and interpret the chatbot’s answers technically is a form of
            programming.&nbsp;</p>



        <p>Equipping your employees with resources to learn and practice AI skills prepares them for the future of work.
            It also gives leadership a greater opportunity to fill future talent gaps internally — everyone wins!&nbsp;
